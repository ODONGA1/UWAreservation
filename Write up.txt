Uganda Wildlife Authority (UWA) Tour Reservation Portalâ€”Integrates real-time availability, online booking, and local tour guide assignment.

1. Tour & Park Information Hub
This is the "shop window" of your portal. It should be visually appealing and easy to navigate.

Park & Tour Listings: Detailed pages for each national park and the specific tours available (e.g., gorilla trekking, game drives, boat safaris).

Rich Content: Include high-quality photos, videos, and detailed descriptions of the user experience, including what wildlife they might see.

Search & Filter: Allow users to easily search for tours by park, activity, duration, and price.

2. Real-Time Availability Calendar
This is the core of the booking engine, preventing overbooking and providing instant confirmation to users.

Visual Calendar: A simple, visual calendar that clearly shows available dates and the number of remaining slots for each tour.

Real-time Updates: As soon as a booking is made, the number of available slots should update instantly across the entire system.

Guide Availability: The calendar should also factor in the availability of tour guides to avoid scheduling conflicts.

3. Simple Booking & Payment Process
The booking process should be as frictionless as possible to maximize conversions.

User-Friendly Form: A clean and simple booking form that collects only essential information (name, number of people, contact details).

Secure Payment Gateway: Integration with a reliable payment provider that accepts both local and international payment methods (e.g., mobile money, credit/debit cards). Popular options in the region include Pesapal, DPO Group, or even global players like Stripe.

Clear Pricing: Display a clear breakdown of costs, including park entrance fees, tour fees, and any applicable taxes.

4. Local Tour Guide Assignment
This feature ensures a seamless experience for tourists and efficient management of your guides.

Guide Profiles: A simple database of UWA-certified local tour guides with their specializations (e.g., birding, primate tracking) and language skills.

Automated Assignment: When a tour is booked, the system can automatically assign an available guide based on the tour type and location.

Manual Override: An administrator should have the ability to manually assign or change guides if needed.

5. Automated Confirmations & Reminders
Good communication is key to a great customer experience.

Instant Confirmation: As soon as a booking is paid for, the user should receive an automated confirmation email and/or SMS with all the tour details.

Pre-Tour Reminders: Send automated reminders a few days before the tour with important information like what to pack, meeting points, and contact details for their guide.

6. Basic Admin Dashboard
This is the back-end of the portal for UWA staff to manage bookings and operations.

Booking Management: A central place to view all upcoming and past bookings.

Guide Management: A simple interface to add new guides, update their information, and view their schedules.

Reporting: Basic reports on booking numbers, revenue, and popular tours to help with planning.
