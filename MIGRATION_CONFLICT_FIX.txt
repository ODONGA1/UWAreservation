MIGRATION CONFLICT RESOLUTION GUIDE

The error occurs because there are conflicting migration files. Here's how to fix it:

STEPS TO RESOLVE:

1. First, let's clean up the migration files:
   - Delete the file: accounts/migrations/0002_notificationsettings_wishlist.py
   - Keep only: 0003_notificationsettings_wishlist.py

2. Clear Django's migration tracking:
   Run: python manage.py migrate accounts --fake 0002_enhanced_profile
   This marks the 0002_enhanced_profile migration as applied without actually running it

3. Then apply the new migration:
   Run: python manage.py migrate accounts

ALTERNATIVE APPROACH (if above doesn't work):

1. Reset all migrations:
   - Delete all files in accounts/migrations/ EXCEPT __init__.py and 0001_initial.py
   
2. Create fresh migrations:
   Run: python manage.py makemigrations accounts
   
3. Apply migrations:
   Run: python manage.py migrate accounts

COMMANDS TO RUN:

# Option 1 (Recommended):
python manage.py migrate accounts --fake 0002_enhanced_profile
python manage.py migrate accounts

# Option 2 (If Option 1 fails):
# First manually delete migration files, then:
python manage.py makemigrations accounts
python manage.py migrate accounts

WHAT THIS WILL FIX:
✅ Resolve migration conflicts
✅ Ensure proper database schema
✅ Allow future migrations to work correctly
