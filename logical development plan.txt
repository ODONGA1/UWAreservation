## 1. User Authentication & Profiles üë§
This is now the foundational layer, as both tourists and guides will need accounts.

Authentication System: Implement a secure registration and login system for tourists using Django's built-in auth module.

User Profiles: Create user profiles to store booking history for tourists and additional details (specialization, availability) for guides. This directly uses the Django ORM to model your users.

Role-Based Access: Differentiate between regular users (tourists), tour guides, and UWA administrators, granting different permissions to each.

## 2. Core Models & Admin Dashboard ‚öôÔ∏è
Using Django's strengths, you'll define the "data" of your application first and manage it through the admin panel.

ORM Models: Define your core database models using the Django ORM: Park, Tour, Guide, Booking, and AvailabilitySlot. This is the "Model" in MVC.

Powerful Admin Interface: Leverage Django's built-in admin to create a secure back-end for UWA staff instantly. This dashboard will manage all the models‚Äîadding new tours, managing guide profiles, and viewing all bookings.

Guide & Availability Management: Administrators will use this dashboard to manage guide schedules and override assignments, directly fulfilling the "Local Tour Guide Assignment" requirement.

## 3. Public-Facing Tour Hub (The "Shop Window") üèûÔ∏è
This is the public part of your site where users browse and search for tours.

Dynamic Pages: Create views (the "View" in MVC) to display detailed pages for each park and tour by pulling data from your models.

Search & Filtering: Implement search functionality allowing users to filter tours by park, activity, and date. Django's ORM makes these database queries efficient.

Rich Content Management: The tour descriptions, photos, and videos will be managed easily through the admin dashboard.

## 4. Booking Engine & Payment Integration üí≥ ‚úÖ COMPLETED
This component handles the interactive booking and financial transaction process.

‚úÖ Availability Logic: Developed the controller logic (the "Controller" in MVC) that checks for available slots in real-time based on tour capacity and guide availability.

‚úÖ Booking Forms: Created user-friendly forms for authenticated users to make bookings. User details are pre-filled from their profile.

‚úÖ Secure Payment Gateway: Integrated framework for local payment providers like Pesapal or DPO Group. Django has secure methods for handling the redirects and callbacks required for these integrations.

NEW BOOKING APP FEATURES:
- ‚úÖ Separate 'booking' Django app created for modularity
- ‚úÖ Enhanced Availability model with real-time checking
- ‚úÖ Comprehensive Booking model with status tracking
- ‚úÖ Payment model ready for gateway integration
- ‚úÖ BookingNotification model for automated communications
- ‚úÖ Rich admin interface for booking management
- ‚úÖ User-friendly booking forms with validation
- ‚úÖ Real-time availability checking via AJAX
- ‚úÖ Mock payment processing system (ready for real gateways)
- ‚úÖ Booking cancellation functionality
- ‚úÖ User booking history and management

BOOKING URLS:
- /booking/ - Browse available tours
- /booking/book/{id}/ - Create new booking
- /booking/booking/{id}/ - View booking details
- /booking/my-bookings/ - User's booking history
- /booking/payment/select/{id}/ - Payment method selection

## 5. Automated Communications üìß
This system keeps users informed after they've made a booking.

Email & SMS Notifications: Use a Django app like django-anymail to handle sending transactional emails for booking confirmations and pre-tour reminders.

Celery for Background Tasks: For reliability, offload the sending of emails and SMS reminders to a background task queue like Celery. This ensures the user doesn't have to wait and makes your application more robust.

## 6. Reporting & Data Visualization üìä
This fulfills your requirement for data visualization, providing insights for UWA management.

Admin Dashboard Enhancements: Integrate a library like Chart.js into the Django admin dashboard.

Key Metrics: Create visual charts and reports to display key data such as revenue per tour, most popular parks, and booking trends over time. This provides actionable insights for UWA.

## 7. Cloud Readiness & Deployment ‚òÅÔ∏è
This ensures your application is built to be deployed and scaled effectively.

Configuration Management: Use environment variables (e.g., with python-decouple) to manage settings like database credentials and API keys, which is crucial for cloud readiness.

Static & Media Files: Configure your app to serve static files (CSS, JS) and user-uploaded media (tour photos) using a cloud storage service like Amazon S3.

Containerization: Package your application using Docker, which makes it easy to deploy consistently on any cloud provider (like AWS, Google Cloud, or Azure).
